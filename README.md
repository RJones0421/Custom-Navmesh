# Custom Unity NavMesh
In this project, I aim to expand upon the work I did in my game engine class (more details [here](https://medium.com/@RJones0421/creating-a-custom-navmesh-b5c75b2fe5d2)). My work in that class was to read in a designated mesh that would serve as the navmesh and find the path through there; with this project I aim to generate that mesh at runtime allowing it to adapt to the level and any changes made by designers. Additionally, I aim to add steering algorithms to the movement to make it more natural and less rigid.

## Currently Working On
My work on this project is currently focused on generating the mesh. As of now, I have added some basic functionality that will display the generated mesh and am working on actually generating that mesh.

## Future Work
A list of features I aim to implement or wish to explore in the future:
- Pathfinding through the navmesh
- Steering algorithms
- Bake the navmesh offline
